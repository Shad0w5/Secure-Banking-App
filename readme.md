- **Performance Testing** - Load testing and resource usage validation
- **Integration Testing** - End-to-end workflow validation
- **Automated Reporting** - Detailed test reports with issue categorization

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **SQLite3** (included with Python)
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt`

## Installation

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Optional: Install QR Code Support
```bash
# For QR code generation during MFA setup
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

## Running the Application

### Start the Banking Application
```bash
python banking_app.py
```

### Application Workflow
1. **Registration**: Create account with strong password and email
2. **MFA Setup**: Configure authenticator app using provided secret/QR code
3. **Login**: Username, password, and MFA code required
4. **Banking Operations**: Deposit, withdraw, view history, verify transactions
5. **Logout**: Secure session termination

## Running the Tests

### Run Security Test Suite
```bash
python test_banking_app.py
```

### Test Categories
- **Security Utils Testing**: Password hashing, encryption, input validation
- **Authentication Testing**: Login security, MFA validation, brute force protection
- **Banking Operations Testing**: Transaction security, authorization controls, race conditions
- **System Security Testing**: File permissions, logging security, error handling
- **Performance Security Testing**: DoS protection, resource limits

### Test Output Files
- `security_test_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` - Detailed test execution log
- `security_test_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Structured vulnerability report
- Console output with real-time test results and summary

## Security Implementation Details

### Authentication Security
- **Password Policy**: Minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Password Storage**: bcrypt hashing with individual salts
- **MFA Implementation**: TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) with backup codes
- **Account Lockout**: 5 failed attempts trigger account lockout
- **Session Management**: Secure authentication state with proper logout

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Fernet symmetric encryption for sensitive transaction details
- **Database Security**: Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- **Input Validation**: Regex-based validation with whitelist approach
- **Transaction Integrity**: SHA-256 hash verification for all financial transactions

### Audit & Monitoring
- **Security Logging**: All authentication and transaction events logged
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages prevent information disclosure
- **Transaction History**: Encrypted audit trail for all account activities
- **Integrity Verification**: Hash-based transaction verification system

## Security Testing Results

The security test suite validates:

### Vulnerability Categories Tested
- **Injection Attacks**: SQL, XSS, Command injection protection
- **Authentication Bypass**: MFA bypass, session hijacking attempts
- **Authorization Issues**: Cross-user data access, privilege escalation
- **Data Exposure**: Sensitive data in logs, error messages, storage
- **Cryptographic Issues**: Weak encryption, predictable tokens
- **Performance Attacks**: DoS protection, resource exhaustion

### Test Coverage
- **50+ Individual Test Cases**
- **5 Major Test Categories**
- **Critical Vulnerability Detection**
